Chat GPT provided the following code using "enunmerate" to iteriate over the data and calculate lower and upper bounds. for mouse, treatment in enumerate(treatments):

Background
Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications, began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

Below is a high level summary followed by all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study.

High level summary
Drug Regimens Capomulin and Ramicane reported the lowest average tumor volume and standard deviation across the study. This suggests Capomlin and Ramincane drug regimens had a greater impact on tumor volume than the other drug regimens.

Based on the analysis, the sex of the mouse was not a factor in this study as the distribution of males to females is 51% to 49%. Further analysis could be performed to determine if sex was a factor in the drug regimen.

Foucusing solely on the Capomulin regimen, it was noted that the higher the weight of the mouse in the study the larger the volume of the tumor on average. The corrleation was quite strong at .84 when comparing the weight of the mouse and its average tumor volume.

Again, focusing solely on the Capomulin regimen and for one particular mouse, it was noted the mouse had a steady increase in tumor volume from 0 to 20 days. Then, between 20 and 30 days there was a sigificant drop with a small uptick at 30 days. Then there was another significant drop between 30-35 days on the drug regiment with another uptick after. This suggests a lead time in the effectiveness of the Capomulin drug at around 20 days. A longer term study would be beneficial to see if the increase in tumor size would continue in an unfavorable way.
